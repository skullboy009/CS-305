Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?
A consulting firm called Artemis Financial focuses on creating customized financial strategies for its customers. Their financial plans include provisions for investments, retirement, savings, and insurance. They are working with Global Rain to modernize their operations, and one of the ways they plan to do so is by utilizing a RESTful web application programming interface (API). Improving the operational security is Artemis Financial's top priority. They are looking to Global Rain's experience to find any possible security holes in their web application. The aim is to thoroughly evaluate the application for possible threats and vulnerabilities, and then produce a report on the vulnerability assessment. This report will act as a guide for putting security measures in place that will successfully mitigate any vulnerabilities found and protect sensitive financial data and Artemis Financial's software from outside threats.

What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?
I successfully used Maven to scan for potential vulnerabilities when I was trying to find security flaws in the client's program. This gave me the opportunity to use automated techniques to fully analyze the dependencies of the software and find any known security vulnerabilities.I carried out painstaking manual code evaluations in addition to using Maven. These involved a careful analysis of the software's codebase, including the built-in API. With the use of this practical technique, I was able to locate potential points of vulnerability entrance, examine coding trends, and find any serious security flaws that automated programs might have missed.A thorough evaluation was guaranteed by combining the strength of Maven's automated vulnerability screening with manual code reviews. Although automatic techniques are effective in locating well-known vulnerabilities, human assessments offer the background necessary to find more subtle security flaws that may result from custom code or unusual usage scenarios.I increased the possibility of finding a variety of security flaws by combining the two methods, from straightforward exploits to more complex and application-specific shortcomings. By using a hybrid approach, I was able to give the customer a comprehensive vulnerability assessment report that guides successful mitigation methods by providing a comprehensive perspective of potential risks.

What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?
One particular problem was handling cases where the automated assessment tools produced inaccurate findings. False positives can impede the entire vulnerability mitigation process and result in the needless deployment of resources. It took a keen eye and the capacity to critically assess the context and specifics of each reported issue to separate real vulnerabilities from false alarms.

How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?
I implemented SHA256 (Secure Hash Algorithm 256) as part of a broader plan to strengthen security measures. In order to improve the protection of sensitive data and prevent unwanted access, SHA256 makes use of both hardware and software components. I added an additional line of defense against future attacks by incorporating the SHA256 encryption algorithm. Because of this additional complexity, it is noticeably harder for hostile actors to compromise the software's security and obtain private data.I would continue to use a combination of automated tools and manual evaluations, as well as include industry best practices, to identify vulnerabilities and decide appropriate mitigation measures in the future. Maven and other automated vulnerability scanning tools, as well as specialized security scanners, are very helpful in rapidly and effectively locating common vulnerabilities. But I would also stress the value of manual code reviews in identifying subtle risks and resolving difficulties unique to particular applications.

How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
It was a painstaking process to ensure the software application's operation as well as security. I used a multipronged strategy that included thorough testing and validation to accomplish this.I first ran the program to make sure it worked and to look for any anomalies or runtime issues that might have affected how well it performed. Through program execution and real-world scenario simulation, I was able to verify that the software fulfilled its intended specifications and performed as anticipated.After SHA256 encryption was put into place, I added a checksum generating procedure for security. This required encrypting data and then producing a checksum. I could determine whether the encryption function worked as expected and whether the data stayed unaltered during the encryption and decryption operations by looking up the checksum. This stage offered a means of confirming that data corruption or inconsistencies were not introduced by the encryption.

What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?
Maven for Vulnerability Detection: Using Maven to find vulnerabilities in a codebase is a useful tool that you may use for other projects in the future. By streamlining the process of looking for known vulnerabilities in dependencies, this tool improves the effectiveness of security assessments. Similar vulnerability detection techniques can be quite helpful in spotting potential flaws and guaranteeing the stability of software.Best Practices for Security: Secure coding techniques, like input validation, appropriate authorization and authentication procedures, and careful error handling, can greatly improve the security of any software program. By implementing these techniques in next tasks, software security and resilience can be built from the ground up.

Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?
Maven Integration: I can talk about how I use Maven to find vulnerabilities. Describe how I used this tool to check for known vulnerabilities in the dependencies of the software. This demonstrates how I may use contemporary development technologies to improve security procedures and lower possible risks. I am able to provide stakeholders with whatever paperwork I have produced, including design documents, diagrams, and technical explanations, in order to properly convey security measures and improvements.This demonstrates my capacity to communicate intricate technical ideas and solutions in a straightforward and intelligible way.
